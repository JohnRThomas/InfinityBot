InfinityBot is an open source client for automation of games that are too tedious to play for real.

NOT AFFILIATED WITH: http://www.infinitybot.org/. That client is fake. I decompiled it and it just has 
webcam capture libraries in it. So I guess if you want creeps watching you while you sleep, download it.
